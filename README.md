The Pi Matrix is a generative tool used in ideation, creativity techniques and project completion. 
The Pi Matrix is presented as a multi-input (4, 8, and 16) algorigram involving an algorithmic execution in three sequential steps. It allows to generate a creative solution according to a multi-tendential context that is intentionally heterogeneous and contradictory. Optimization relies on the relevance of the tendential poles at the start, then their logic to converge in a reflexive and related way towards a central core during its resolution.
The use of the Pi Matrix in educational, professional, or training settings proves to be an accelerator of creativity, as well as a guidance instrument and structural benchmark for operational and strategic purposes. It is part of the «decision aids» in its way of visualizing a context, synthesizing, classifying and re-identifying issues, assess the challenges and rationalize the margin of action before setting a goal, obtain original solutions related to the socio-economic and macro-environmental realities of a situation.
